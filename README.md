## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Heroku

This project is a collaborative effort where we built an API that is hosted on a live server using vanilla JS, Node, Express and Heroku. The data given by our API is being sent to the end user device, which is then accessed by the main JS to display correlating game results and computer results to the DOM.
